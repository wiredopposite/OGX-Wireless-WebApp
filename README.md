# OGX-Wireless Web App
This web app is meant for connecting to, and changing settings on, your OGX-Wireless Bluetooth adapter. It has been developed for Chrome browser on Windows, other operating systems or browsers may not display or work correctly.

## Settings
The UI will initially display your current active profile options, if you choose a different profile from the dropdown, it will load the settings from that profile into the UI. Your last saved profile will become your current active profile.

## Connection issues
If you run into connection issues, such as nothing happening after selecting "Pair", clear Chrome's file cache, reset or power off/on the OGX-Wireless adapter, and reload the webpage. 

You can clear Chrome's cache by clicking the 3 dots in the top right corner of the window, selecting "Clear browsing data", selecting "Cached images and files", and clicking "Clear data". Do not select anything else besides "Cached images and files" if you want to keep all your login info and history intact.
